Description: # Alibi Model Explainer
        
        [Alibi](https://github.com/SeldonIO/alibi) server is an implementation of a KFServer for providing black box model explanation for KFServer models.
        
        To start the server locally for development needs, run the following command under this folder in your github repository. 
        
        ```
        pip install -e .
        ```
        
        After pip has installed dependencies you should see:
        
        ```
        	      Successfully installed alibiexplainer
        ```
        
        You can check for successful installation by running the following command
        
        ```
        usage: __main__.py [-h] [--http_port HTTP_PORT] [--grpc_port GRPC_PORT]
                           [--predict_url PREDICT_URL] [--method {ExplainerMethod.anchor_tabular}]
        __main__.py: error: the following arguments are required: --predict_url
        ```
        
        ## Samples
        
        To run a local example follow the [income classifier explanation sample](../../docs/samples/explanation/alibi/income/README.md).
        
        ## Development
        
        Install the development dependencies with:
        
        ```bash
        pip install -e .[test]
        ```
        
        The following indicates a successful install.
        
        ```
              Successfully installed alibiexplainer
        	      
        ```
        
        To run static type checks:
        
        ```bash
        mypy --ignore-missing-imports sklearnserver
        ```
        An empty result will indicate success.
